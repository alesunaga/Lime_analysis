# Visualizing Website Traffic and Lime Sales

This repository contains Python code that generates visualizations of website traffic and lime sales data. The code uses the `matplotlib` library to create two plots: one showing website visits per month and another showing the number of limes sold per month for different lime species.

## Data

The code uses the following lists as data:

* **`months`:** A list of month names (Jan to Dec).
* **`visits_per_month`:** A list of website visits for each month.
* **`key_limes_per_month`:** A list of key lime sales for each month.
* **`persian_limes_per_month`:** A list of Persian lime sales for each month.
* **`blood_limes_per_month`:** A list of blood lime sales for each month.

## Visualization

The code generates two plots:

1. **Visits per Month:** A line plot showing the trend of website visits over the months.
2. **Limes per Month:** A line plot showing the sales of different lime species (Key, Persian, and Blood) over the months.

The plots are saved as PNG files (`Visits_per_Month.png` and `Limes_per_Month.png`).

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the `matplotlib` library installed. You can install it using `pip install matplotlib`.
2. Run the Python script.

## Output

The code will produce two plots:

* **`Visits_per_Month.png`:** A line plot showing website visits per month.
* **`Limes_per_Month.png`:** A line plot showing the number of limes sold per month for different lime species.
